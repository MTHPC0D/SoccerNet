Succernet Challenge is a computer vision project designed to tackle specific challenges in image recognition and classification.

## Description

The Succernet Challenge aims to provide a robust framework for developing and testing computer vision models. This project focuses on accurately classifying and recognizing objects within images. It leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to achieve high performance.

Key features include:

- Advanced image processing algorithms
- High accuracy object recognition
- Scalable architecture for handling large datasets

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## installation

To install Succernet Challenge, you need to have Python installed. Use the package manager pip to install the necessary dependencies

pip install soccernet

Requirements : 
- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.0+
- OpenCV 4.0+
- NumPy 1.18+

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
If you need help or have any questions about the Succernet Challenge project, you can reach out to us through the following channels:

## Roadmap
Here are some planned features and improvements for future releases of Succernet Challenge:

- Advanced Match Action Statistics: Implement advanced statistical analysis of match actions to provide deeper insights.
- Player Recognition: Enhance the system to accurately recognize individual players.
- Team Recognition: Develop capabilities to identify and distinguish between different teams.
- Detailed Action Predictions: Improve the model to provide detailed predictions of match actions.
Feel free to suggest new features or improvements by opening an issue on the GitHub repository.
